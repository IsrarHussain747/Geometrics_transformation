## Introduction
Geometric transformations are crucial in computer vision for modifying images by changing their geometric properties such as size, orientation, and position. This notebook provides examples of how to apply common transformations using OpenCV.

### Transformations include:
- **Scaling**: Resizing images.
- **Translation**: Shifting the position of an image.
- **Rotation**: Rotating the image around a point.
- **Affine Transformation**: Applying a linear mapping between two-dimensional planes.
- **Perspective Transformation**: Changing the viewing perspective of an image.

## Requirements
Before running the notebook, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy

You can install the required libraries using:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/geometric-transformations-opencv.git
cd geometric-transformations-opencv
pip install -r requirements.txt

```bash
pip install opencv-python-headless numpy jupyter
